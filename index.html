          About us

          The Importance of Disability Awareness Training
          <div class="w-auto h-auto relative font-normal p-8">
            The Central Statistics Office report that 13% of the Irish population have a disability. It is therefore reasonable to assume that most people will have interactions with people who have a disability.
            Disability Awareness Training has become an essential tool in cultivating an inclusive and accepting environment which is compliant with legislation and provides valuable insight into how to develop your disability inclusive strategy for colleagues, customers, and peers.

          Disability Awareness Training in the Workplace and Community Groups
          <div class="w-auto h-auto relative font-normal p-8">
            Disability Awareness training improves customer service for clients with disabilities and creates a more diverse and inclusive workplace to support all staff. By identifying misconceptions and promoting a respectful and inclusive environment, employees attending our courses will gain necessary skills and confidence when interacting with colleagues and customers who have a disability. Promoting equality through Disability Awareness Training, eliminates discrimination and creates an open and welcoming environment.<br><br>
            Our courses are compliant for funding from The Department of Social Protection. <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/service/3970b5-disability-awareness-support-scheme/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600">The Disability Awareness Support Scheme (DASS)</a> provides employers in the private sector with 90% funding towards the cost of Disability Awareness Training in the first year and 80% funding in subsequent years up to a maximum of €20,000.<br><br>
            Our training programmes provide attendees with an understanding and awareness of issues surrounding the disabled community through specific information on:<br>
            •	relevant anti-discrimination and equality legislation,<br>
            •	reasonable accommodations,<br>
            •	government incentives for businesses to hire people with disabilities,<br>
            •	disability etiquette to clarify appropriate language and behaviour,<br>

          Schools
          <p class="w-auto h-auto relative font-normal p-8">
            Our Disability Awareness course for schools, promotes inclusion, and cultivates an environment of acceptance of diversity, thus preventing or reducing bullying within the school environment.<br><br>
            By identifying and rectifying misconceptions and enhancing a respectful environment, students develop knowledge of significant issues relevant to those within the disabled community and gain confidence in their interactions.<br><br>
            A Universal Design approach to courses at AbilityWise, ensures that diverse learning styles are considered, and a range of pedagogical methods are enforced through our highly interactive course such as through the use of;<br>
            •	a PowerPoint Presentation,<br>
            •	photographic analysis,<br>
            •	simulations,<br>
            •	videos,<br>
            •	etiquette awareness discussions and advice,<br>
            •	interactives games and<br>

            Students learn both independently and within groups in a fun but sensitive manner.
            As tutors delivering our courses also have an invisible disability, the course is relatable, and students are provided with an opportunity to ask questions directly to someone with a disability. This also ensures the increased comfort of students with disabilities in attendance of the course.
            Courses are a minimum of 3.5 hours long with extended courses available. Bespoke courses can be tailored to match the needs within your school.

          Testimonials
          <div class="w-auto h-auto relative font-normal p-8">
            "It was my lucky day when Deirdre responded to my shout out on a popular on-line book club. I needed a sensitivity reader for my novel, which included a character with Down Syndrome. Not only did she make available to me all her vast expertise in the fields of disability and inclusivity, I benefited from her enthusiasm; she immediately became a great advocate for the book, as much invested in it as I was. She helped me resolve issues with insight, patience and a great sense of humour. Plus - and perhaps best of all - I made a new friend."<br>
